      <p>We built the software that makes it <span class="blue bold">as easy as possible for you</span> to create tailor made sports betting strategies, leveraging machine learning models and historical data. </p>


        <p>The ML model is trained on a large data set to produce custom made, AI- optimized +EV betting systems.  Sharp bookmaker odds are analyzed to determine the baseline probabilistic market price. Discrepancies between the baseline odds, and available odds on various sports books are quantified to identify scenarios where odds deviate favorably from the fair market price. This represents a +EV edge.
